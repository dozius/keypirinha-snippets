# Snippets
#
# * The plugin is triggered when you start typing any of the root keywords
#   defined in this file.
# * All defined snippets will appear as ordered in this yaml document.
#
# * Examples:

Examples: # This is a root level 'directory' that holds the indented snippets
          # below, indentation is important (whitespace is ignored unless it's
          # part of a multiline string)

  Multiline string: | # This is a multiline snippet, defined by '|'
    This is
    A multiline
    Snippet

  Text emojis: # This is a 'sub-directory' of 'Examples' that contains snippets
    shrug: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    bear: ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

# Basic snippets, not in the 'Examples' directory 
root_string_1: This string is not hidden behind any menu or keyword
root_string_2: This string is also not hidden and easily accessible
