### Manually

* Download `Snippets.keypirinha-package` from the
[releases](https://github.com/dozius/keypirinha-snippets/releases/latest) page.
* Copy the file into `%APPDATA%\Keypirinha\InstalledPackages` (installed mode) or
  `<Keypirinha_Home>\portable\Profile\InstalledPackages` (portable mode)

## Usage

Snippets items are added to the
[Catalog](http://keypirinha.com/glossary.html#term-catalog). Select these items to
list and search all user defined snippets. Selecting a snippet copies it to the
clipboard.

Snippets items are defined in the configuration YAML file.

### Configuration

The configuration file `snippets.ini` can be auto-generated by entering 
`configure package snippets` in Keypirinha.

The readonly documentation for Snippets will appear alongside the config file,
reference the documentation to define your own snippets.

The configuration file `snippets.yml` will not be auto-generated, it will need
to be created in the `%APPDATA%\Keypirinha\User` (installed mode) or
`<Keypirinha_Home>\portable\Profile\User` (portable mode) directory.

There is an example YAML file included.
